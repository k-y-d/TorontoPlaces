# TorontoPlaces
Demo Android app for Toronto Points of Interests, partially done.
Implemented partially the Android app using MVP pattern, RxJava/RxAndroid + Retrofit + Gson, as below:
- Login Activity with hard-coded username/password as 'demo' in the Model layer
- PlaceList Activity, with linear and grid view and persistent favourites
- Both above Activities handle the configuration change (rotating device) properly.
- For Bixi locations, implemented the Model with web request using Retrofit 
- Some Unit Tests
